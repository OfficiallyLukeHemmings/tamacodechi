# Tamacodechi

## Project Description
Tamacodechi is a refresher project for managing coding projects. Focusing on employing the MERN stack using the MVC architectural pattern, this project serves as a practical example of a modern web application built using MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js, alongside Vite. 

## Technologies
- **Vite**: Used as the build tool for frontend develoment due to its hot reloading development server and its efficient build process.
- **MongoDB (Mongoose)**: MongoDB is used to store and manage the application's data. Mongoose, an Object Data Modelling (ODM) library for MongoDB, facilitates schema-based modelling for managing and querying the MongoDB database.
- **Express**: Minimalist web framework used to build the backend of the application (API), handling routing, middleware and server-side logic.
- **React**: Used to facilitate the necessary interactivity in the application.
- **React Router**: Used for managing navigation and routing within the single-page application, enhancing user experience.
  
## Demo (Coming Soon)
As this is just a refresher project, I will not be hosting this one as a demo, but will instead provide a link to a demonstration video to show the functionality once the project is complete.
